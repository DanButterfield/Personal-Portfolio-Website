# Personal Portfolio Website with HTML and CSS

## Overview

Portfolio Website with user friendly navigation in a clean and modern Layout.

I developed this website to gain some front-end developement experience with HTML and CSS which I learnt from youtube 
videos from the channel [EJ Media](https://www.youtube.com/@EJMedia1) Through these tutorials, I gained a solid understanding of both HTML and CSS and applied them to build a responsive, visually appealing portfolio to showcase my skills and projects.

## Key Features:

* Reponsive Design: Having a seamless experience on whichever device a user is viewing, as the screen scales depending on which device someone is using
* Navigation: A clean and easy to navigate layout ensuring easy browsing.
* About me: Information about myself, my education and skills.
* Projects: Dedicated section to my independant projects outside of education with links to their repositories
* Contact information including my LinkedIn, Gmail and Github
* Resume section.

## Technologies:

* HTML: for all the information going into the website
* CSS: for the styling and navigation of the website.

## What I learnt:

* Basic principles of web design: How to create a visually pleasing website ensuring easy browsing, and ensuring user friendliness
* Code Orginisation: keeping clean organised code is best for performance and readability and this is showcased through this project
* Responsive Design: Having interactive features with the CSS to provide a better experience for viewing on other devices.

 ## Future Improvements:

* Experience: I plan to add to my about me or add a new section for my experiences
* Projects when doing more Independant Projects I will add these to the Projects section with links to their repositories on Github
